The full stack for cybersecurity 
encompasses a wide range of technologies, 
practices, and processes to protect systems, 
applications, and data from threats and 
vulnerabilities. It includes:

Network security: 
Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, 
and network segmentation.

Application security: 
Secure coding, vulnerability 
management, and secure 
configurations.

Endpoint security: 
Antivirus/anti-malware, 
host-based firewalls, 
and data loss prevention.

Data security: 
Encryption, access controls, 
data classification, and 
backup/recovery mechanisms.

Identity and access management (IAM): 
User provisioning, 
authentication, and 
authorization controls.

Cloud security: 
Securing cloud infrastructure, 
data storage, and access controls.

Security monitoring and incident response: 
SIEM, intrusion detection, 
and incident response planning.

Physical security: 
Surveillance systems, access 
controls, and environmental controls.

Vendor and supply chain security: 
Assessing and managing risks 
associated with third-party 
suppliers.

Mobile security: 
Secure coding, secure app 
distribution, and mobile 
device management.

Web security: 
Secure authentication,
web application firewalls, 
and secure transport protocols.

Social engineering prevention: 
Employee training, phishing 
simulations, and access controls.

IoT security: 
Device authentication, secure 
communication protocols, and 
monitoring mechanisms.

Incident response and forensics: 
Processes to detect, respond
to, and investigate security 
incidents.

Threat intelligence and information sharing: 
Collecting and analyzing 
threat data to proactively 
mitigate risks.

Continuous monitoring and security assessment: 
Vulnerability scanning, 
penetration testing, and 
security assessments.

Security awareness and training: 
Educating users about 
security best practices.

Secure DevOps: 
Integrating security practices 
into the software development
and operations process.

Red teaming and ethical hacking: 
Simulating real-world attacks 
to identify vulnerabilities.
DLP, cloud security governance, 
secure SDLC, insider threat 
management, and more.
